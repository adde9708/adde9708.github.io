# SynCrypt

**A local-first, encrypted, peer-to-peer knowledge vault
with a graph-aware data model and a Rust core.**

SynCrypt combines the strengths of modern knowledge tools
with the performance and security of native systems programming.

No cloud.
No subscriptions.
No central servers.

## Why SynCrypt?

Modern note-taking tools excel at *thinking*  
Peer-to-peer sync tools excel at *syncing*

SynCrypt does both — without compromise.

- 📁 **Local-first** by default
- 🔐 **End-to-end encrypted** everywhere
- 🌐 **Peer-to-peer sync** using libp2p
- 🧠 **Graph-aware storage** (not just files)
- ⚙️ **Rust core** for performance and correctness
- 🔄 **CRDT-based merging** for conflict-free sync

Your data lives on your devices.
Your devices sync directly.
Your knowledge stays private.

## What SynCrypt Is

SynCrypt is three things at once:

### 🗄 An encrypted vault

Your files are stored locally, encrypted at rest,
and addressed by content — not filenames.

### 🧠 A living knowledge graph

Backlinks, references, and relationships are first-class data,
not UI tricks layered on top of text files.

### 🌐 A sync swarm

Devices discover each other, exchange encrypted deltas,
and converge deterministically — even offline.
