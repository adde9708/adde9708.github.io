# 1. Core Principles

These principles came directly from the initial realization:

## 1.1 Local-first by default

* Files live on your machine.
* You control them.
* No cloud dependency.

## 1.2 Peer-to-peer sync without subscriptions

* If Syncthing can sync terabytes for free, so can your notes.

## 1.3 End-to-end encryption everywhere

* Encrypted blocks
* Zero trust
* Per-share symmetric keys

## 1.4 High performance with Rust

* Rust enables fast chunking, CRDT merges, and a lightweight
  daemon.

## 1.5 Graph-aware storage

* SynCrypt understands backlinks, references, metadata, and edges
  — and syncs them intelligently.
